# habit-quest
This project uses Python with Flask to build the backend logic for a gamified habit tracker. The Flask app handles routing, user sessions (placeholder for now), habit logging, XP calculation, and level progression. When a user completes a habit, the backend updates their XP and checks for level-ups based on predefined thresholds.
